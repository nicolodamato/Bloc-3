# Challenge : predict conversions 🏆🏆

In this project, you will participate to a machine learning competition like the ones that are organized by https://www.kaggle.com/. You will be able to work with jupyter notebooks as usual, but in the end you'll have to submit your model's predictions to your teacher/TA, so your model's performances will be evaluated in an independent way. The scores achieved by the different teams will be stored into a leaderboard 🏅🏅

### Goals 🎯
The project can be cut into four steps :

- Part 1 : make an EDA and the preprocessings and train a baseline model with the file data_train.csv
- Part 2 : improve your model's f1-score on your test set (you can try feature engineering, feature selection, regularization, non-linear models, hyperparameter optimization by grid search, etc...)
- Part 3 : Once you're satisfied with your model's score, you can use it to make some predictions with the file data_test.csv. You will have to dump the predictions into a .csv file that will be sent to Kaggle (actually, to your teacher/TA 🤓). You can make as many submissions as you want, feel free to try different models !
- Part 4 : Take some time to analyze your best model's parameters. Are there any lever for action that would help to improve the newsletter's conversion rate ? What recommendations would you make to the team ?
